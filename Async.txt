Default js
Javascript is synchronous, one code will execute then next code
- single threaded, only one code can execute at a time

Javascript is event driven, when an event occurs, a callback function is called

blocking code vs non blocking code
- blocking code will block the flow of program -read file sync
- non blocking code will not block the flow of program, not block the execution of program , read file async
